# ♻️ E-Waste Warehouse Management System

A Django-based platform designed to **track, register, and manage e-waste warehouses, buyers, and sellers** — helping bring accountability and visibility to Pakistan’s e-waste recycling network.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project aims to reduce the environmental impact of improper e-waste handling by providing a digital system to:

- Register **tenants (buyers/sellers)** of e-waste  
- Track **warehouses and their locations**  
- Record **items, purchase rates, and invoices (slips)**  
- Maintain **secure, transparent transaction history**  

The goal is to replace informal, paper-based processes with a reliable digital registry that can later evolve into a **national-scale tracking platform**.
